## Description

[Project Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CX8B-FnFz4eNc5BEfbYDJVx8BeK2CB9D/view?usp=sharing)

This project aims to provide a virtual reality application in which physical therapy patients can strengthen their knee joint by playing a game. The game simulates kicking a soccer ball into a goal, where the power and accuracy of the kick is determined by the range of motion that the patient achieves. The game itself is a Unity application which utilizes the HTC Vive headset and trackers to immerse the patient in the VR world.
